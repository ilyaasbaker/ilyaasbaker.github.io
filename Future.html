        <p class="futuretxt2">I’ve created more art than I know what to do with, one thing I definitely don't want to do is to waste everything I’ve created over the past four years.<br/><br/> I want to be able to bring my art to life so I can have it in physical form, and there are multiple ways to achieve that, Clothing being one of them, so over the next couple of years I’ll be working on creating a brand. I once said to a friend of mine “T-shirts are my canvas” and I really need to make that a reality.<br/><br/>Of Course not everything I’ve made will look good on an item of clothing so another avenue for me to look into is the NFT space.</p>
