            <p id="description">I was previously involved in the design of apparel at HMD before transitioning into camera work. During my tenure, I had the opportunity to establish and contribute to a newly established department. Apart from designing graphics for apparel, I also undertook the task of creating new uniforms for HMD's recently opened branch in Qatar.In this particular role, I was responsible for designing technical packages, commonly known as "tech packs," which served as essential documents sent to apparel manufacturers. These comprehensive packages included detailed specifications, measurements, and instructions, ensuring accurate and efficient production of the garments.</p>

        <p id="description">Bits and Pieces is an Event Management Company located in Dubai. It marked my first foray into CAD, and I found myself facing a tight deadline of just two days to complete a design. With limited knowledge and no prior experience, I quickly embarked on researching and watching a few instructional YouTube tutorials. Opting for AutoCAD as my preferred software, I immediately began working on the project.

        Fortunately, the individual I was collaborating with at the company simply required me to translate their 2D sketch into a digital format. Although initially challenging, my previous experience exploring 3D software such as Blender proved to be helpful. Over time, I grew more proficient and managed to deliver the final design just in the nick of time, meeting the deadline successfully.</p>
